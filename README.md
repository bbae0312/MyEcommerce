# MyEcommerce

Welcome to the MyEcommerce project! This repository contains both the frontend and backend code for a comprehensive E-commerce platform.

## Overview

- **Frontend**: Built using React, this part of the project offers a dynamic and responsive user interface for customers to browse products, add them to the cart, and make purchases.
- **Backend**: Powered by Strapi, the backend provides a robust API for product management, user authentication, order processing, and more.

## Directory Structure

- `client/`: Contains all frontend code built with React.
- `server/`: Houses the Strapi-powered backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- A local or remote instance of a database supported by Strapi (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)

## Getting Started

## Backend (Strapi)

### Overview
The backend is powered by Strapi, a headless CMS providing the necessary API endpoints for product management, user authentication, order processing, and other essential E-commerce operations. Strapi offers a visually intuitive admin panel to manage the content and monitor the operations of the E-commerce platform.

### Setup & Running

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd server/
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ### `npm install`

3. **Start the Strapi Server**:
   ### `npm run develop`
   
Once the server starts successfully, the Strapi admin panel will be accessible at http://localhost:1337/admin.

### Frontend (React)

**Overview**  
The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library known for its efficiency and flexibility. The interface provides users with a dynamic and responsive platform to browse products, manage their cart, and complete their purchases. Additionally, it interacts seamlessly with the Strapi backend to fetch products, manage user sessions, and process orders.

### Setup & Running

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd client/
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ### `npm install`
3. **Start the Strapi Server**:
   ### `npm start`

The application will then be accessible at http://localhost:3000, and it will automatically open in your default browser.
