# MyEcommerce

Welcome to the MyEcommerce project! This repository contains both the frontend and backend code for a comprehensive E-commerce platform.

## Overview

- **Frontend**: Built using React, this part of the project offers a dynamic and responsive user interface for customers to browse products, add them to the cart, and make purchases.
- **Backend**: Powered by Strapi, the backend provides a robust API for product management, user authentication, order processing, and more.

## Directory Structure

- `client/`: Contains all frontend code built with React.
- `server/`: Houses the Strapi-powered backend.

## Prerequisites
